**Wendy Reid:** Two goals, maintenance ten issues and feature requests.  
… After a year, it is worth talking about the issues..  

### 1. maintenance issues.
{: #section1}

**Ivan Herman:** we can update the spec, because these changes are not significant. Feature requests we need to determine how significant they are and this could mean a revision of the specification..  
… It is important to remember this process..  

#### 1.1. duration property when using t= fragment selectors (issue audiobooks#110)
{: #section1-1}

_See github issue [audiobooks#110](https://github.com/w3c/audiobooks/issues/110)._

<!-- issue w3c/audiobooks/110 -->



**Andreas Duchen:** duration is unclear because of fragments and total resource requirement..  

**Ivan Herman:** We did not realize that the media URL can giv a duration. What the issue suggests is wrong. and we need to clarify in the spec..  

**Lars Wallin:** Unclear what the fragment identifier is intended to do and will make the spec fragile..  

**Wendy Reid:** If you need to use frag ids use it in the navigation and not in the total duration..  

**Ivan Herman:** this is a restriction on the audio book spec, not in the manifest one..  
… If we make a change, we need to test to make it part of the rec. It should also be labeled as errata..  

> **Proposed resolution: Change Reading Order section to clarify that the url: MUST NOT contain fragment identifiers, and the duration should be of the entirety of the audio file, in the audiobooks document.** *(Wendy Reid)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Ivan Herman:* +1.

> *Laurent Le Meur:* +1.

> *Wendy Reid:* +1.

> *George Kerscher:* +1.

> ***Resolution #1: Change Reading Order section to clarify that the url: MUST NOT contain fragment identifiers, and the duration should be of the entirety of the audio file, in the audiobooks document.***
{: #resolution1 .resolution}

**Wendy Reid:** will make the change in the editors version.  

#### 1.2. Add note about the importance of adding the "duration"  property to readingOrder items (issue audiobooks#108)
{: #section1-2}

_See github issue [audiobooks#108](https://github.com/w3c/audiobooks/issues/108)._

<!-- issue w3c/audiobooks/108 -->



**Lars Wallin:** We want the sum of the audio files to be equal to the entire audio book..  
… this is needed to support streaming. We don't want to download everything to get this information..  
… You need to easily determine where you want to go in the entire book..  

**Laurent Le Meur:** A reading system must be able to jump to a specific location in a specific track, when the user opens an audiobook and wants to start from the position he has left during a previous session. For that the duration of an item in the reading order must be mandatory..  

> **Proposed resolution: In the audiobooks document, elevate the requirement for reading order item level duration to a MUST.** *(Wendy Reid)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Wendy Reid:* +1.

> *Ivan Herman:* +1.

> *George Kerscher:* +1.

> *Laurent Le Meur:* +1.

> ***Resolution #2: In the audiobooks document, elevate the requirement for reading order item level duration to a MUST.***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

**Wendy Reid:** will make change in editorial spec..  

> *Lars Wallin:* @bigbluehat I plan to bring up some web annotations a little later, if there is time, just so you know ;).

**Ivan Herman:** The two enhancements are fairly significant and we should check with Tzviya and Matt if we should republish the spec. This requires testing..  
… We need to make it highly visible to implementers..  

**Wendy Reid:** This came from implementors and we need to find a way to get it in front of implementors..  

**Ivan Herman:** Also, we have to be careful about editing the text: the differences in the editors spec have to be tracked. It is not the normal editing, and more needs to be done to track changes..  

### 2. future request issues.
{: #section2}

**Wendy Reid:** This covers what I really wanted to address..  
… if any of the other issue need to be added, it could trigger a charter revision..  
… See list of issues from the agenda..  
… These are all open issues and we don't know if they are important and needed..  

**Lars Wallin:** Now that we have resolved the above two issues, it resolves the other requests..  
… Now that we have a range we can trust, it makes it easy to do deep linking..  
… We can also do annotations that are anchored to an image or a range..  
… We should add package level support for fragments..  

**Ivan Herman:** two items of requiring TOC should be considered as a must is similar to the previous issues insofar as minor (though normative) changes..  
… also, for the media fragment, we need to clarify whether we can specify a fragment id in the LPF media type without defining the media type for the ZIP media type in general..  

**Lars Wallin:** CFI did this for the EPUB media type. We need to go into this in more detail..  
… but we need to check into this..  

**Andreas Duchen:** EPUB CFI is noted in Web Annotations spec, too..  

**Wendy Reid:** we have open issues that needs to be discussed. We need more implementers input and do more research..  

**Ivan Herman:** We will need to ask about the possible need to recharter. We should check with Tzviya..  
… We put forward a PR for republishing and see what feedback we get..  
… I am confident we can do it as a rec update, but not sure..
